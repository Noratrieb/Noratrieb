# hi 👋

I'm Nilstrieb, I live in Switzerland and I like to code some stuff.

There's not much to see here, but you might be interested in my [UMLetClassParser](https://github.com/Nilstrieb/UMLetClassParser)  
Or my amazing [Calculator](https://github.com/Nilstrieb/BasicConsoleCalculator) (its actually good (not really))
